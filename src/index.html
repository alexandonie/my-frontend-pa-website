    <h3>What it has to offer?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Basic styling</h4>
        <p>
          “Normalized” typography elements, buttons and links nicely placed on the home page for you to start setting up
          your project the way it was designed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Flexibility</h4>
        <p>
          With es6 modules, sass and handlebars, you can organize the project whatever way you want. Split, move around,
          bring back together, you’re in control.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Local access from any device</h4>
        <p>
          Test your sites and apps on anything connected to the same network. Get the same live reload development
          experience on your phone, tablet, vm, etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Clean URLs</h4>
        <p>
          No more .html in your url. Every html page created will be placed in a folder with the same name to obtain
          extension free URLs for the best surfing experience.
        </p>
      </li>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Why would I use this?</dt>
      <dd>
        You would use this to save time, to get rid of the frustrations the front-end development tools have to offer. You would use this to focus on actual work and provide more value which in exchage will bring you value.
      </dd>

      <dt>Are there any caveats?</dt>
      <dd>
        In software, anything can go wrong and at some point it will go wrong. This little tool is no different, so if you find something, don’t shy away, reach out on github or twitter and let us know so we can fix it ASAP.
      </dd>

      <dt>What about support?</dt>
      <dd>
        This tool is heavily used for medium to big static websites on a daily basis so the support would not be a problem. It will always be up to date and issue free.
      </dd>

      <dt>What else can I use it for?</dt>
      <dd>
        Anything you want. You can use it as it is for static websites, you can tweak it for something else, change it to fit your needs, use it as a base for your own boilerplate, anything!
